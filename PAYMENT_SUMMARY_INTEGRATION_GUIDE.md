# EcoWasteGo Payment Summary Integration Guide

## 💰 **Complete Payment Summary & Payment Workflow**

I've implemented a **seamless payment summary integration** that automatically connects the recycler's weight calculation with the customer's payment review. This creates a complete workflow from weight entry to payment acceptance.

## 🔄 **Workflow Overview:**

### **1. Weight Calculation** ⚖️
```
Recycler arrives → Enters weight → Calculates payment → Sends payment summary
```

### **2. Payment Summary Generation** 📋
```
Weight + Waste Type + Rate → Subtotal + Environmental Tax → Total Amount
```

### **3. Customer Payment Review** 💳
```
Customer checks payment → Reviews summary → Accepts/Rejects payment → Completes transaction
```

## 📱 **Screen Integration & Updates:**

### **TrackingScreen Updates:**
- ✅ **Payment Status Monitoring**: Continuously checks for payment summary availability
- ✅ **Dynamic Payment Button**: Changes from "Check Payment" to "Payment Ready!" when summary is available
- ✅ **Real-Time Updates**: Shows payment status and amount when available
- ✅ **Smart Navigation**: Routes to payment summary or shows waiting message

### **PaymentSummary Screen Updates:**
- ✅ **Real Data Integration**: Uses actual calculated values from recycler
- ✅ **Complete Information**: Shows weight, waste type, rate, subtotal, tax, and total
- ✅ **Parameter Passing**: Receives all payment details from tracking screen
- ✅ **Payment Actions**: Accept or reject payment with full details

## 🎯 **Key Features:**

### **Automatic Payment Summary Detection:**
```typescript
// Payment summary polling system
const startPaymentPolling = () => {
  const paymentInterval = setInterval(async () => {
    if (hasArrived && !paymentSummary) {
      await checkPaymentSummary();
    }
  }, 5000); // Check every 5 seconds after arrival

  return () => clearInterval(paymentInterval);
};
```

### **Smart Payment Button Management:**
```typescript
// Dynamic payment button based on summary availability
<TouchableOpacity 
  style={[
    styles.checkPaymentButton, 
    paymentSummary && styles.checkPaymentButtonActive
  ]} 
  onPress={handleCheckPaymentDue}
  disabled={isLoadingPayment}
>
  {isLoadingPayment ? (
    <Text style={styles.checkPaymentButtonText}>⏳ Checking...</Text>
  ) : paymentSummary ? (
    <>
      <Feather name="credit-card" size={20} color="#1C3301" />
      <Text style={styles.checkPaymentButtonText}>💰 Payment Ready!</Text>
    </>
  ) : (
    <>
      <Feather name="credit-card" size={20} color="#1C3301" />
      <Text style={styles.checkPaymentButtonText}>💰 Check Payment</Text>
    </>
  )}
</TouchableOpacity>
```

### **Intelligent Payment Checking:**
```typescript
const handleCheckPaymentDue = async () => {
  if (!paymentSummary) {
    // No payment summary yet - show waiting message
    Alert.alert(
      '⏳ Payment Summary Not Ready',
      'Your recycler is still calculating the weight and preparing your payment summary. Please wait a moment and try again.',
      [
        { text: 'OK' },
        { 
          text: 'Check Again', 
          onPress: async () => {
            setIsLoadingPayment(true);
            await checkPaymentSummary();
            setIsLoadingPayment(false);
          }
        }
      ]
    );
    return;
  }

  // Payment summary exists - navigate to payment summary screen
  router.push({
    pathname: '/customer-screens/PaymentSummary' as any,
    params: { 
      requestId: requestId,
      recyclerName: trackingData?.recyclerName || recyclerName,
      pickup: trackingData?.pickupAddress || pickup,
      paymentSummaryId: paymentSummary.id,
      weight: paymentSummary.weight,
      wasteType: paymentSummary.wasteType,
      rate: paymentSummary.rate,
      subtotal: paymentSummary.subtotal,
      environmentalTax: paymentSummary.environmentalTax,
      totalAmount: paymentSummary.totalAmount
    }
  });
};
```
