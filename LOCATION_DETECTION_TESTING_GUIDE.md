# 🧭 Location Detection Feature Testing Guide

## 🎯 Feature Overview
The automatic location detection feature allows customers to automatically set their pickup point based on their device's GPS location. When a customer presses the "Use My Location" button, the app:

1. Requests location permission
2. Gets current GPS coordinates
3. Converts coordinates to a human-readable address
4. Displays location with accuracy information
5. Allows the customer to confirm and use the location
6. Automatically navigates to the SelectTruck screen with the detected location
